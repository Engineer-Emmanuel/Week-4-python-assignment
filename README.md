## 🖋️ 1. File Read & Write Challenge
- Reads the content of a text file (`input.txt`).  
- Modifies the content (in this example: converts all text to uppercase).  
- Writes the modified version into a **new file** (`output.txt`).  

---

## 🧪 2. Error Handling Lab
- Prompts the user to enter a filename.  
- Attempts to open and read the file.  
- Handles errors gracefully if:  
  - The file doesn’t exist.  
  - The file can’t be read due to permissions.  
  - Any other unexpected error occurs.
